                C++ is an object-oriented programming language that many people use for many
                different programs. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 and published in 1985,
                 C++ is used for things like operating systems, neural networks, video games, 
                 embedded systems, scientific computing and more! 
                 <span id="BjarneS"></span>
                 It has impacted the world of technology 
                 in a huge way, and is still completely relevent today! No matter if you are just starting 
                 out learning or have known C++ for years, there's always something modern you can make 
                 in C++! Let's dive in deeper to this awesome programming language...

                        Bjarne Stroustrup was born on <b>December 30th, 1950</b> in <b>Aarhus, Denmark</b>.
                        <a href="#sources" onclick="srcHighlight(1)"><span class="badge text-bg-success rounded-pill">1</span></a>  He is 
                        a Danish Computer Scientist who graduated from <b><u>Aarhus University</u></b> located in 
                        Aarhus, Denmark in 1969. After he graduated, he left with a Candidatus Scientiarum in mathematics 
                        with computer science. He went on to get a PhD in computer science, obtaining it from 
                        the University of Cambridge. More importantly to our topic, Stroustrup started development 
                        on C++ during the begining of his career at the Computer Science Research Center of Bell Labs 
                        located in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He started the development of this language, originally 
                        planned to be called "C with Classes" in 1979. He released it to the public in 1985 and charged 
                        <span id="TLI"></span>
                        $75 USD for shipping of the compiler and basic libraries before the internet was popular.
                        It was for non-commercial use only. He also published <em>The C++ Programming Language</em> book

            <h4>
                C++ is an object oriented language (don't know how many times we've said that already) that 
                was derived from the C programming language and the reason for development was to make an 
                object oriented version of C.

                            Embedded systems are small systems that consist of a 
                            processer, memory units and i/o device. They are things like 
                            calculators, smartwatches, smartphones, printers, credit card readers, 
                            and more. They are built for ONE specific purpose only, unlike a standard computer 
                            which are more so have a general purpose and can preform many tasks, not being 
                            built to do one specific thing over and over.

                        <h4>
                            Game Development is the creation process of making or building 
                            a video game. C++ is a great language to develop games with because 
                            it's object-oriented, allowing for easy duplication of things, for example 
                            enemies or monsters in a video game. You can create multiple enemies 
                            with the same features or abilities without having to recode a whole entire 
                            enemy because of the polymorphism aspect of Object Oriented Programming. 
                            C++ is also good for more or less manual memory management, meaning the programmer
                             has more control over where variables are stored in the computer and can control 
                             what happens with them. C++ also has great performance on devices, allowing for a 
                             smoothly running game for a more optimized experience on many systems.

                            to solve extremely difficult, tedious, complex problems. 
                            <a href="#sources" onclick="srcHighlight(3)"><span class="badge text-bg-success rounded-pill">3</span></a> 
                            C++ is great for this 
                            because computational science requires a lot of hardware manipulation, and C++
                             makes that much easier to do. Again, it has great performance, which is great 
                             for solving those kinds of problems as quick and precise as possible.

                        <h4>
                            Operating systems is a type of software that a computer boots into when 
                            you turn it on. It is basically a way to give the user a graphical interface 
                            so that they can navigate their computer and all of its features with ease. 
                            Drivers are softwares that allow for the operating system to interact with 
                            hardware. For example the graphics driver in your computer allows the OS and the 
                            graphics card to communicate with each other. C++ is great for these tasks because 
                            as we've mentioned multiple times, C++ is able to talk with the hardware very well and 
                            performes well at tasks like this.

                            C++ is great for creating 
                            these types of softwares because of its features such as vectors (expandable arrays of data), 
                            logical memory organizationn and management, and it's ability to help process multiple tasts 
                            at once.

                Many perks that were listed above consisted a lot about how good C++ is at memory management 
                and talking with the hardware of a device. C++ has features that make memory management easy (by 
                using data types to create a variable) or more manual (with terms like "new" and "delete", including
                pointers).

                    <h4>
                        C++ was created for several different reasons, but Prof. Stroustrup's main reason to develop C++ 
                        is because he wanted to make a language that had classes and objects. He also wanted it to 
                        have great performance and be able to manipulate the hardware more directly, "which at that time 
                        the best language for that was C" said Prof. Stroustrup in his interview with Big Think.
                        <a href="#sources" onclick="srcHighlight(6)"><span class="badge text-bg-success rounded-pill">6</span></a>
                        Prof. Stroustrup found his inspiration to make an object-oriented language because of Ole-Johan Dahl 
                        and Kristen Nygaard's object oriented programming language called SIMULA. He saw great for versatility,
                        being able to make multiple objects of any defined class. "And that is where I came in, and so C++ has 
                        classes like SIMULA but they run as fast as C code, so the combination becomes very useful." Prof. Stroustrup 
                        says at this interview. It is true that this combination is very useful, as we see in video games. 
                        For smoothly running, fast games, you need code that can run fast and preform great. 
                        It makes it <span id="worldImpact"></span>
                        easier to create games like this because of classes and objects, since you can make one enemy with 
                        specific code, while then just creating clones of that initial enemy. This is why all of the topics 
                        (listed in the previous section) use C++.

            <h3><b>The World and C++</b></h3>
            <h4>
                You can find C++ practically anywhere, especially in the things listed in section 2. 
                You can even find things that were programmed in the oldest version of the language 
                still running strong today. That was one of Prof. Stroustrup's goals, have C++ be 
                reliable enough to keep running programs, no matter how old it gets. If you've programmed 
                something in C++, chances are you will never have to re-program it in the latest versions 
                of the language because it will work reliably either way.
                <a href="#sources" onclick="srcHighlight(6)"><span class="badge text-bg-success rounded-pill">6</span></a> 
                New updates to C++ mainly focus on making it easier to use, not modify the language entirely. 
                This is why C++ is used in so many different places. Not only is it reliable for most tasks, 
                makes things easier to program, and can get into the low-level machine hardware, but it 
                also never has to be modified for the latest changes. Once a program is finished, it stays finished 
                unless the programmer wants to change something about it. This is helpful for things like games, 
                <em>minecraft</em> for example, has over <b> 1.8 million </b> lines of code (or roughly 500,000, no one really knows).
                <a href="#sources" onclick="srcHighlight(7)"><span class="badge text-bg-success rounded-pill">7</span></a> 
                 The point is, reguardless, it would be and absolute pain to rewrite all of that code each time a C++ update released. Even though they don't rewrite all the code,
                 the game still runs great and on many platforms (this is bedrock edition, if you couldn't tell by now), and 
                 the developers can still add updates and keep on creating more content for the game.

                showing that it is not willing to die out. While this is just a brief description/view 
                of what C++ is, there is so much more to it. So I encourage the reader on the other side 
                of this screen right now, that if you are interested in learning C++, to do more research, 
                understand, program, and execute, and you'll be able to make anything you imagine. Who knows, 
                maybe you will be the one to code the next hit game. Or the one to make the next high-end encryption 
                software for government data. The possibilities are <em>endl</em>ess, my friend. The sky isn't
